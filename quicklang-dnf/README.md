# Quicklang

Quicklang is a Bash script that simplifies the installation of programming languages on your Linux system. It automates the process of checking for dependencies and installing the desired programming languages with just a few commands.

## Getting Started

**Download the script**: Clone or download the Quicklang script from the GitHub repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/Autcoder/Auto-languages-installer.git
```

**Navigate to the Script Directory**: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the Quicklang script is located.

**Run the Script**: Execute the Quicklang script by typing the following command in the terminal:

```
bash ./quicklang-dnf.sh
```

### Usage

- When you run the Quicklang script, it will automatically check for dependencies (tar, curl, and make) required for installation. If any of these dependencies are missing, the script will prompt you to install them.

- After ensuring that dependencies are met, the script will ask you to specify the programming language you want to install. Simply type the name of the language and press Enter.

Quicklang will then execute the necessary commands to install the specified programming language on your system.

To exit the script, type "exit" or "quit" and press Enter.
